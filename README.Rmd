# rirods2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rirods2 is a pure R client for iRODS

## Installation

You can install the development version of rirods2 like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MartinSchobben/rirods2")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to quickly launch a local iRODS server, connect with R, and perform some actions. For more information on the iRODS demo server check https://github.com/irods/irods_demo.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# clone the repo
# git clone https://github.com/irods/irods_demo
# initiate git submodules
# git submodule update --init
# to start
cd ../irods_demo
docker-compose up
```

Then to connect a project from R with the iRODS server you have to provide the host name of the server, like so:

```{r start}
library(rirods2)

# connect project to server
create_irods("http://localhost/irods-rest/0.9.2")
```

In this example Bobby is a user of iRODS and he can authenticate himself, like so:

```{r, bobby}
# login as bobby
iauth("bobby", "passWORD")
```

Suppose Bobby would like to upload an R object from his current R session to an iRODS collection. For this, use the iput command:

```{r put}
# some data
foo <- data.frame(x = c(1, 8, 9), y = c("x", "y", "z"))

# check where we are
ipwd()

# store
iput(foo)

# add some metadata
imeta(
  "foo", 
  "data_object", 
  operations = 
    list(operation = "add", attribute = "foo", value = "bar", units = "baz")
)

# check if file is stored with associated metadata
ils(metadata = TRUE)
```

If Bobby wanted to copy the foo R object from an iRODS collection to his local directory, he would use
iget:

```{r get}
# retrieve in native R format
iget("foo")

# delete object
irm("foo", trash = FALSE)

# check if object is removed
ils()
```

Possibly Bobby does not want a native R object to be stored on iRODS but a file type that can be accessed by other programs.

```{r filetypes}
library(readr)

# creates a csv file of foo
write_csv(foo, "foo.csv")

# send file
iput("foo.csv")

# check whether it is stored
ils()
```

```{r rmfile1, include= FALSE}
file.remove("foo.csv")
```

Later on somebody else might want to download this file again and store it locally.

```{r csv}
# retrieve it again later
iget("foo.csv")
read_csv("foo.csv")

# delete object
irm("foo.csv", trash = FALSE)
```

```{r rmfile2, include= FALSE}
file.remove("foo.csv")
```



<!-- The user Bobby can also be removed again. -->

```{r rmbobby, include=FALSE}
# authenticate
iauth()

# remove user bobby
rirods2:::iadmin(action = "remove", target = "user", arg2 = "bobby")

# check if bobby is removed
ils()

# clean-up irods file
file.remove("rirods2.irods")
```

## Stop your local iRODS server

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker-compose down
```
